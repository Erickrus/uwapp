# uwapp


Implement a TUI based on [urwid](//github.com/urwid/urwid) library in Python 3 (somehow like the old style Turbo Vision). Basically, launch from terminal e.g. putty.exe, you can access the Menu and Dialog box. This version is currently not fully polished. But it works. Feel free to fork it!


```shell
sudo pip3 install urwid
git clone https://github.com/Erickrus/uwapp
cd uwapp
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`

python3.6 uwapp/app.py
```
